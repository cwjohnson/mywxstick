To install these libraries so the Arduino IDE can import them...

1. Create a zip of the of library directory. Use the same name as the name
   of the library directory itself. Hence MyLibrary.zip is a zip archive
   of the source files in the MyLibrary library contained in the MyLibrary
   directory.
2. Go to your Arduino IDE. Sketch->Import Library... Browse to and select the
   .zip file you create in step one above.
